# ProjBTechTest
Files and executable for the Project B Tech-Demo.

All content is free for anyone to use and modify, though I would strongly influence to only use the code as a form of reference at most.


This project took about one and a half week, along with a few late nights, to complete. This project is a demonstration for us, the developers, to show around and give evidence of the having skill needed to make a game happen. This project is by no means a game on it's own though, and treating it like one will leave you surely disappointed. This should be treated as what it is, an experiment. Anyhow, there was plenty of information and features I wish could have made it, but the deadline had already passed and though I loved working on it, I'm very happy it's done.

*IMPORTANT* - This demo has no exit feature, in order to exit, you will need to either open in windowed mode or use Alt + Tab/Windows Key

SPOILER
How to find all easter eggs ;)
1 - Lava Easter Egg: The first one is easy to get to, but will require that you have NOT went through the red-cube dialog. When you first launch the demo, walk to the lava room and let the dialog play. If you're impatient, you can Alt Tab and click back in to get the invisible barrier to remove. Anyhow, once your in, simply fall into the lava pit. There, you will hear your first easter egg. PS: Don't have explorer mode enabled either
2 - Blue Easter Egg: If you didn't find this one on your own, then I'll be amazed. In the play room, put an object into the blue crystal and it will turn it cyan. The script that controls this easter egg is named greenEasterEgg, don't ask why.
3 - Explorer mode: Explorer mode gives access to the last easter egg and to a couple of fun settings. When you launch explorer mode, you can alter your walk speed and throw force. Upping your throw force will allow you to throw, well, very hard. While upping your player speed will allow you to walk, well, very fast. Get it? Also you can go negative in value to see what happens :3. Oh yeah, and if you want to know how to get into explorer mode, you'll have to play until the end and enter the room with a fire in it. Listen to the dialog that plays.
4 - White Easter Egg: This is actually an easter egg based around a glitch. First off, you MUST have explorer mode enabled to view this easter egg. Once that is achieved, go to the lava room and take the path to get close to the far left corner (this is assuming what you would see if you were standing at the inital lava room enterence). From there, wait till you near the bottom and keep pushing forward to grip the corner. Once you're in the corner, hold left-shift and move left, while looking slightly right. You should glitch through and drop on a relativly small map below. That map was the map used for all development up until the Viewer's Rehaul update. Once you're done there, simply walk into the crystal to return.


Inventory System:
There was actually two contributors to this project, though I was the main one. However, my partner (CamMister) had been working on an inventory system that didn't make it due to time constraints. Yet, here is a picture to show what it could have looked like:

The first image shows the UI look, with the second showing a little bug that actually looked like a fun one. If this system would have made it, then it simply would have been glued in with the features you already play with, only difference being that left-clicking on an object that is not grabbed would instead throw it into your hotbar for you to carry around without dropping. Placing the object back down would work the exact same as right-clicking.



Thank you all so much for looking at this demonstration. If you have any questions, comments, or concerns THAT ARE NOT OBVIOUS BUGS, then feel free to email me at: 901365.dmw@gmail.com. Otherwise, enjoy the rest of your day!
PS: I already get plenty of spam to my email account, that's why this is my public one. :)
